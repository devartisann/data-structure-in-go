# Data Structures in Go (Golang) 

Welcome to my personal journey of mastering data structures in Go (Golang)! This repository contains my implementations of a wide range of data structures, created as part of my self-learning process. I’m sharing this publicly to invite comments, suggestions, and contributions from the community.  

### Contents
- Arrays
- Linked
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- And more!

### Features 
- Clear and well-documented code to aid understanding
- Practical examples and real-world usage scenarios
- Unit tests for each data structure to ensure reliability
- Insights on performance considerations and optimizations

### Getting Started 
Feel free to clone the repository and explore the various data structure implementations. Each directory includes a README with detailed explanations, usage instructions, and implementation notes to support your learning. 

### Contributions and Feedback
I welcome your feedback and contributions! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional data structures to add, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let’s learn and grow together!
